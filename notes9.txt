Subdomain Take-over::

--> CNAME(canonical name) is used to map one domain to another domain without giving IP Address.

==> Suppose, I own a website named meowsecurity.com and I want to point to Github page when user clicks help.meowsecurity.com. For this, I used CNAME to map help.meowsecurity.com to the Github_repo_XYZ. After few years, I deleted Github_repo_XYZ but didn't delete the CNAME record that was used to map Github_repo_XYZ with help.meowsecurity.com. Anyone who will visit help.meowsecurity.com now, will see " 404 Page Not Found ".
In this case, security researcher will try to takeover the domain by creating the same subdomain at the cloud service provider(Github etc)  uploading index.html. 

URL:: https://github.com/EdOverflow/can-i-take-over-xyz
Tool::  dig <domain_name>
        nslookup <domain_name>
	subzy (github)
	subjack (apt install)
	nuclei (install according to github) ( run once in shell, then directory will installed in .local )
