Github Recon and Sensitive data exposure:

::Methods::

1. Manually:
	1. Go to Github and search:
		a. "repo" "dork"
		b. "subdomain"
		c. "target.com" API_key
		d. "api.target.com"
	2. Use NOT, to exclude any keyword.
		example: "defronix.com" passwd NOT test
	3. (optional) Follow the repo-owner to know him and his code better.


2. Automated:

	1. GitDorker - https://github.com/obheda12/GitDorker = requires github API
